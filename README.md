# Arduino-OS
Whats this? This is a OS which i am making in my free time. I am here using a EEPROM (AT24C16N) which has a million write cycles according to the data sheet. Using some buttons a I2C LCD communication driver, and a LCD to make a OS which dosent require another PC's help (serial or something).

# What do i need to have to make this?
Here is a list of items u need for this:

Arduino UNO/MEGA/NANO (ur choice)
EEPROM->AT24C16N
jumper wires (many)
some buttons
and ther u go!
(btw dont forget to upload the code lol)

# Can i edit this and use it?
Well i havent given much explination is the code, just go thru it and edit it.

## Happy using this OS/editing it!
