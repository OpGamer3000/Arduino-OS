```Still working on it, its not complete yet (scraped pervious code)```
# Arduino-OS
Whats this? This is an OS which i am making in my free time. I am here using an EEPROM (AT24C16N) which has a million write cycles according to the data sheet, some buttons, an I2C LCD communication driver and a LCD to make an OS which is indipendent.

# What do i need to have to make this?
Here is a list of items u need for this:<br><br>

Arduino UNO/MEGA/NANO (ur choice, if the requirments are more...will list it down)<br>
* EEPROM->AT24C16N<br>
* jumper wires (~20)<br>
* some buttons<br>
* and ther u go!<br>
(btw dont forget to upload the code lol)<br><br>

# Future of this OS thing?
Even idk, this is one of my another intresting reandom thing which came to my mind. I have to do a lot of work right now, like:<br>
adding more options<br>
adding more things to eeprom intrepeter(should be easy)<br>
<br>
