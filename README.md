# Arduino-OS
Whats this? This is a OS which i am making in my free time. I am here using a EEPROM (AT24C16N) which has a million write cycles according to the data sheet. Using some buttons a I2C LCD communication driver, and a LCD to make a OS which dosent require another PC's help (serial or something).

# What do i need to have to make this?
Here is a list of items u need for this:<br><br>

Arduino UNO/MEGA/NANO (ur choice)<br>
EEPROM->AT24C16N<br>
jumper wires (many)<br>
some buttons<br>
and ther u go!<br>
(btw dont forget to upload the code lol)<br><br>

# Can i edit this and use it?
Well i havent given much explination in the code, just go thru it and edit it.

# Future of this OS thing?
Even idk, this is one of my another intresting reandom thing which came to my mind. i have to do a lot of work right now, like:<br>
Using all the 8 sector of the eeprom, by giving a int then converting it into a byte, which will be used to sellect the address at the specific sector(most difficult part)<br>
adding more options<br>
using esp-01 for internet stuf<br>
making a simple input driver(in the futer it will help a lot, like using this to make notepad?)<br>
adding more things to eeprom intrepeter(should be easy)<br>
<br>
yea basicaly thers a hell lota work to do...<br><br>
